## Stand-ups

Our stand-ups occur in-class (Tuesday and Thursday) 10 minutes after class starts (9:10 am). This allows students coming in late to participate while minimizing the time wasted in the beginning of the day. Stand-ups should be short and sweet and discuss the following:
* What you accomplished
* Issues with items worked on
* What you plan to do
* Other issues that may affect your future work not related to this course (increased workload from other courses, etc.)

Outside of stand-ups and in-person meetings, we frequently communicate on Slack and use our team channel as our primary method of communication.


## Burndown

Our team uses a burndown chart to track overall progress during each sprint. The hours in the burndown chart are derived from logs in the kanban directory. Within each task inside the kanban directory, there are logs of hours spent on the task by developers.

A sprint lasts two weeks. Our team comes up with a project backlog of tasks we need to accomplish according to the scenarios we wrote. We then decide which tasks should be completed by the end of the sprint. Each task has an initial estimate that can change. You can also add new tasks to the sprint if necessary. The burndown chart is created with Microsoft Excel. A screenshot of one of the sprint's burndown charts is provided below:

## Kanban

Our team uses kanban directories in order to visualize work and optimize flow of the work in the team. We were not allowed to use popular software such as JIRA. Our professor required that implemented kanban this way so he could track our progress through Git. Our kanban directory contains four subdirectories:
1. to_do
2. in_progress
3. review
4. done

Tasks start in the to_do directory and spend most of their lives in the in_progress folder. Once completed, they spend some time in the review/testing directory until the team decides that it is unlikely that there will be any further changes made by the customers before it is moved to the done directory.

Each task follows a similar template found here: https://github.com/ededej/BlueBankAppAndroid/blob/master/agile/kanban/to_do/Template.txt

## Retrospective

Our team did not have a normal sprint retrospective. Our project lasted about 6 weeks or for 3 sprints. With the end of each sprint, we presented what we accomplished, what we did well, what we had problems with, and our future goals to the class. We were then given feedback about our product by the opposing team and our professor.
